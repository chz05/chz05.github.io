<!-- ### Welcome!

Theoretical physics is a branch of physics that focuses on the development of mathematical models and theories to understand and explain natural phenomena.
It plays a crucial role in our understanding of the fundamental laws of the universe and the fundamental particles that make up all matter.
Research in theoretical physics helps us to make predictions about how the universe works and to test these predictions through experiments.
It also helps us to understand the fundamental principles that govern the behavior of matter and energy, and to explore the limits of our current knowledge.
Theoretical physics helps us to make progress in a wide range of fields, including cosmology, particle physics, and quantum mechanics, and it has led to many important discoveries and technological innovations. -->

### About me

I am a master student at Columbia University working in the field of Computer Architecture.
I received my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from the University California of San Diego (UCSD) in 2023 and went on to earn my master degree from Columbia University in 2024.
During my master study, I am advised by Prof. Tanvir Ahmed Khan, working on compiler-based simulation infrastructure research project. This work has been submitted into ISCA 2025. 


My research interests: Hardware Accelerators, Simulation.
