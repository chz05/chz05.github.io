<!-- ### Welcome!

Theoretical physics is a branch of physics that focuses on the development of mathematical models and theories to understand and explain natural phenomena.
It plays a crucial role in our understanding of the fundamental laws of the universe and the fundamental particles that make up all matter.
Research in theoretical physics helps us to make predictions about how the universe works and to test these predictions through experiments.
It also helps us to understand the fundamental principles that govern the behavior of matter and energy, and to explore the limits of our current knowledge.
Theoretical physics helps us to make progress in a wide range of fields, including cosmology, particle physics, and quantum mechanics, and it has led to many important discoveries and technological innovations. -->

### About me

I am a master student at Columbia University working in the field of Computer Architecture.
I received my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from the University California of San Diego (UCSD) in 2023 and went on to earn my master degree from Columbia University in 2024.
During my master study, I am advised by Prof. Tanvir Ahmed Khan, working on compiler-based simulation infrastructure research project. This work has been submitted into ISCA 2025. I am applying for PhD programs, and I expect to graduate in Fall 2024. Please reach out to me if your are looking for PhD students.


My research interests: Hardware Accelerators, Simulation.

Data center applications' diverse and complex nature necessitates a sea of accelerators to achieve end-to-end performance acceleration. Unfortunately, existing simulation techniques struggle to model data center accelerators at scale while maintaining rapid execution and sufficient detail. This paper introduces a compiler-based framework that enables fast simulation of data center accelerators at scale with comprehensive insights. The framework incorporates a novel MLIR dialect to model accelerator placements and invocation patterns, paired with a performance and energy estimation engine. This combination provides detailed performance metrics and energy analysis, empowering architects to optimize speed and efficiency early in the design process. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness with two case studies: (1) a placement and invocation model for data center accelerators and (2) acceleration of data restructuring and movement. In both cases, the framework supports rapid simulation at scale with detailed insights, yielding results that align closely with previous work.
